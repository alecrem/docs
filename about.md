## ABOUT

Similar to Art Blocks on the Ethereum, fx(hash) on the Tezos, PolyBlocks is an open platform for generative NFTs.  
Its excellent user interface allows artists to mint their artworks in a very simple process.  
Our tokens are based on ERC-721. Please visit <a href="https://polygonscan.com/address/0x0EbA52CccC57052CDB43EAE1D7d0B2715A0fe24E#code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="inline-anchor">polygonscan</a> for the smart contract.  

## HOW IT WORKS

- mint your artwork to our smart contract via “mint button” in a menu.
- your artwork will be listed in our marketplace.
- an NFT (Token) will be generated once a collector makes a purchase.


## CURRENTLY BETA

Polyblocks is still in its early stages: it is in beta. Please keep in mind that bugs may occur.  
We strongly recommend keeping the price low so that people can experiment and test your tokens for now.  
We hope that the token contract wound not be updated, but that could very well happen.  

## COSTS

Polyblocks charges 3% of platform fees, and so for the whole duration of the beta. You do not have to pay any extra charge for us.
